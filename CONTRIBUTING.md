# Contributing

This is a new project and community so the development process is fairly lightweight.
I believe in continuous improvement and I want this project's processes to grow organically over time based on feedback.
This approach should produce a concise and efficient workflow which promotes quality and doesn't place unnecessary burden on developers.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and it should be followed when interacting with others.
