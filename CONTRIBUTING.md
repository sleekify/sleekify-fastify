# Contributing

This is a new project and community, so the development process is fairly lightweight.
I believe in continuous improvement and want this project's processes to grow organically over time based on feedback.
This approach should produce a concise and efficient workflow that promotes quality and doesn't place unnecessary burden on developers.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which must be followed when interacting with others.
